# micro-frontend-experiments

A collection of Micro Frontend and Web Component experiments.

## Project Structure

The repository uses [lerna](https://lerna.js.org) to make it easier to have independent projects at the same time all get to work together as a single one.

All the independent projects are inside `packages` and can all be developed and run independently.

## Usage

After cloning this repository run `npm install`, this will install all the dependencies, including all packages' dependencies.

To run the experiments at the top of the repo run `npm start` which will then run all the required servers and open a browser with the main UI.
